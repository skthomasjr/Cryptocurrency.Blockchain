Cryptocurrency.Blockchain is a library for interacting with the Blockchain Data API provided by Blockchain. [The Blockchain Data API](https://blockchain.info/api/blockchain_api) is provided by [Blockchain](https://blockchain.info).

The API library is implemented using [NetClient.Rest](https://github.com/skthomasjr/NetClient.Rest) - an asynchronous REST API client that allows you to make API calls using LINQ syntax. See the [assembly help documentation](http://skthomasjr.github.io/Cryptocurrency.Blockchain/Site/Help/Index.html) for help on usage and code samples.
